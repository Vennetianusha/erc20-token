# ERC-20 Token – MyToken (MTK)

## Overview
This project demonstrates the creation of a basic ERC-20 token using Solidity.  
The smart contract was developed, compiled, deployed, and tested using Remix IDE on the Remix VM environment.

This project helps in understanding how ERC-20 tokens work on the Ethereum blockchain, including balance tracking, token transfers, and allowance mechanisms.

---

## Token Details
- **Token Name:** MyToken
- **Symbol:** MTK
- **Decimals:** 18
- **Total Supply:** 1,000,000 MTK
- **Standard:** ERC-20

All tokens are minted to the deployer account at the time of deployment.

---

## Features
- ERC-20 compliant token implementation
- Balance tracking using `balanceOf`
- Token transfers using `transfer`
- Allowance mechanism using `approve`
- Delegated transfers using `transferFrom`
- Event emission for `Transfer` and `Approval`

---

## Smart Contract
- **File:** `MyToken.sol`
- **Language:** Solidity ^0.8.x

The contract defines token metadata, manages balances, handles transfers, and follows standard ERC-20 practices.

---

## Development Tools
- Solidity
- Remix IDE
- Ethereum Remix VM
- GitHub for version control

---

## Deployment
The contract was:
1. Written in Solidity
2. Compiled successfully with no errors
3. Deployed using Remix IDE on the Remix VM
4. Tested for balance checks and token information

---

## Testing
The following functionalities were tested:
- Token metadata (`name`, `symbol`, `decimals`)
- Total supply verification
- Balance check of deployer account
- Successful contract deployment

Screenshots of compilation, deployment, and testing are included in the `screenshots` folder.

---

## Screenshots
The `screenshots` folder contains:
- Compilation success
- Deployment confirmation
- Token information
- Total supply verification
- Balance verification

---

## Conclusion
This project provides a foundational understanding of ERC-20 tokens and smart contract development using Solidity. It serves as a beginner-friendly introduction to blockchain development.
